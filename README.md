# Pomodoro-Application
My completion of the Day 28 project challenge: The Pomodoro Application using tkinter.


This is my completed version of the pomodoro application using Python from Day 28 of Udemy's 100 Days of Code.
This work is completed per the course specifications. However, I would like to add some more functionality to it.
I'm looking to add a [Pause] button. Otherwise, the application itself is completely fucntionable. The pause button
would actually be quite simple, but may require some reworking of the start button as well (I can't quite remember if I specifically
set the [Start] button to work itself and restart the beginning of the timer or if it will start from where it has left off).
I'll have to look into that. Feel free to take a look, comment, make recommendations.

I looked into to trying to use PyInstaller to create an executable version of this application so you can run it directly without having python installed.
However, I've been having some issues with getting it to run successfully as I've had little practice with that module. I'll keep working on it. If you know a better way
or have a better understanding on how to get PyInstaller to create a functioning executable, I always welcome advise and notes. Enjoy!
